You should be here if you are experiencing a problem uploading (but not compiling/"verifying" - if that doesn't work, go here), and you are using an 8-bit AVR-based Arduino board that is programmed via the serial port (ie, using a bootloader), and does NOT have native USB. For example, an Arduino Uno, Mega, Pro Mini or Nano. This is also generally applicable to third party hardware packages that use a serial bootloader (like Optiboot). This guide is not appropriate for the Leonardo/Micro (that has native USB) or anything that you're programming using an ISP programmer (this isn't using a serial bootloader).
