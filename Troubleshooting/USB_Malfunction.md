If you see the Windows "This USB Device has malfunctioned" error when you connect your Arduino, Arduino clone, or USB Serial Adapter, it's bad news. This error typically indicates a serious hardware fault in the USB serial adapter - if the board previously worked, something very bad happened to it. If the board never worked, check for poor solder joints around the USB serial adapter (I've seen this on home-made serial adapters when one side of the crystal on the adapter is open or shorted)

Note: if you are using a board that utilizes "VUSB" (such as a USBAsp, or one of the digispark clones), some hubs and ports may be incompatible with your device - these devices are not technically compliant with the USB spec. I have observed, for example, certain USB hubs on which VUSB devices give "Device has malfunctioned" errors. You may have better luck using it through a hub (or different hub), or plugged into a different USB port.
